This controller supports:
- Arbitrary switch graphs, including loops and multiple switches
- Broadcast packets traverse a MST
- Unicast traffic follows the shortest path between the source and destination
- Multicast traffic is treated as broadcast traffic
- Dynamic topologies (e.g., links coming and going while the controller is running)
